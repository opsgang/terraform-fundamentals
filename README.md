## What is and Why Terraform?

### What?

    * IaC - governance, repeatability

    * Infrastructure | Platform provisioning
        ... not really for OS / app level configuration
        ... it's not a cfg management tool really.

### Why?

    * Mutable vs. Immutable || Build time vs. Deploy time.

    * Procedural vs. Declarative

    * Client Vs. Client/Server or Master/Agent

    * Maturity

See [post by gruntworks.io][1] for thorough explanation and comparison.
